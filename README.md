# phptemplateengine

## Some background
Long time ago i did PHP MVC framework project. It was my project, basing on 3 other (not mine projects) and my own ideas. One of these ideas was templating engine i did myself because nobody had something i got used to working with Laravel and other frameworks (not always PHP frameworks)  

Ok, so i did such project. LAMP is not my stack anymore, it was long time ago. But i decided to refresh my PHP knowledge and code that project again. Coding in PHP is fun, writing frameworks is fun, OOP is fun.  

So i do parts of mvc php framework (like router, template engine and so on) as standalone, one-day projects. Then i plan to somehow combine them into one mvc framework, improve, create something even better than my old project.  

Here we've got templating engine. Dont mind router class, ill do router as a separate project.
